Added square brackets and the missing `id=\"\"` attribute.\r\n* Bug fix: PHP 5.3 compatibility issue.\r\n* Improvement: \"Add new\" button has been moved down right before the sidebars list.\r\n* Improvement: Added a notice where the sidebars list is empty.\r\n* Improvement: Implemented a tooltip plugin to provide help tips easier.\r\n* Improvement: Implemented select2 plugin. Now the interface is more user friendly.\r\n* Improvement: The plugin has been moved from a subpage to a top level admin page.\r\n\r\n= 3.1 =\r\n* Added localization support(if you want to translate it in your language, create a pull requests on Github).\r\n* Added shortcode with ID to each sidebar.\r\n\r\n= 3.0 =\r\n* **Complete rewrite from scratch.** The plugin now allows to create an unlimited number of sidebars without the need to touch a single line of code in your theme.\r\n* Now you can use conditions to apply the sidebar on any page, post ar CPT you wish. _Soon will be added support for taxonomies, 404 page and other(please suggest)_.\r\n* The widgets now use the theme style and tags. That means the newly generated sidebars will look good on any theme, no need for additional styling.\r\n* Modular code. You can create and register your own conditions. That's mainly not required but can be handy for some developers.\r\n\r\n= 2.3.2 =\r\n* Quick fix UI. When a new sidebar is created, it display an incorect info and it was fixed only after page refresh.\r\n* Removed unused files, since version 3.0 is on development `smk_sidebar_metabox.php` was removed, as it was never used and is not required for the next versions.\r\n\r\n= 2.3.1 =\r\n* Quick fix for shortcode smk_sidebar ID.
